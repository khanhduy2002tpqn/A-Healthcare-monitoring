# A-Healthcare-monitoring
**Issue:**
Currently, healthcare has been receiving increasing attention, but not everyone has enough time and financial resources to undergo regular health check-ups at medical facilities. Therefore, we need a system that can conduct health assessments right at home. Diabetes is one of the crucial health issues globally, affecting millions of people. Early diagnosis and management of diabetes pose a challenge, especially for those who do not have easy access to healthcare facilities or lack the time to monitor their health.

**Project Objective:**
The objective of the home health monitoring and diabetes prediction system with Edge Computing is to provide convenience and self-health management for users. By offering smart devices and sensors, the system enables users to monitor vital health indicators such as blood glucose levels, blood pressure, and heart rate right in the comfort of their homes. Additionally, the system utilizes Edge Computing to predict diabetes based on health data. It analyzes the collected data and assesses the risk of diabetes, helping users to recognize and promptly respond to their health conditions.
